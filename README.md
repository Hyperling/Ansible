# ansible
Getting real with my system management using ansible-pull.

This setup is specific for my devices and my needs. You're welcome to use it as an example for your needs, but do not expect it to work as-is.

## Currently Supported Linux Systems
### Debian Family
#### Debian
But only if you can get a recent enough version of Ansible. `pip` likely works better than `apt` for this.
#### Ubuntu
100%
#### Pop!_OS
100%
#### Mint
But not really used by me, just tested it for fun.
#### Parrot OS
Still testing, but so far so good!

### Arch Family
#### Arch
100%
#### Manjaro
100% at some point, but started shying away from zsh.

## Currently Supported Unix Systems
### FreeBSD
100% but untested since 12.1.
Software choices are slightly more limited since not flatpak-enabled.
Has not been attempted on FreeBSD 13 yet.

## Waiting To Be Tested
### Kali Linux
### Arch Linux ARM 
Specifically for the Pinephone.
