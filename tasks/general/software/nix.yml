# Install the Nix package manager
# https://nixos.org/download/

## TBD ##
# This may be able to replace Flatpak if it works well, is easy to use, takes up
#  less space, is faster, etc etc. It also is supposed to have the benefit of
#  working with FreeBSD and MacOS which is something that the current array of
#  Ansible/package/Flatpak combo is lacking. Honestly might make FreeBSD as a
#  desktop a possibility again since it was software availability that continues
#  to be the reason to leave it. Could also get rid of all the distro-specific
#  package names, and maybe packages.yml in general?? That stuff can be a mess.
